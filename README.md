> ✨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Installation

Run `yarn` or `npm install`.

## Available Scripts

### yarn dev

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### yarn build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.

## Docker?

We use Docker to build a production image of the frontend (which is simply an nginx server that hosts the static build files). It's not needed for development.
