# Contributing

Want to add a new system? Are the docs not clear enough? We're always accepting contributions so please share any new features, improvements or bug fixes with us.

## Installing, building & running

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

### npm run dev

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of the site to the `dist/` folder.

## Docker?

We use Docker to build a production image of the dashboard (which is a simple NGINX server that hosts the static build files). It's not needed for development.
